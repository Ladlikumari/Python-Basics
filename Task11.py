Write a Python program that checks whether a password is Strong, Medium, or Weak based on the following rules:

Strong Password
At least 8 characters long
Contains at least one uppercase letter
Contains at least one lowercase letter
Contains at least one digit
Contains at least one special character (@#$%^&*!?)
Medium Password
At least 6 characters long
Contains letters and digits
Weak Password
Anything else """

password = input("Enter your password: ")

has_upper = False
has_lower = False
has_digit = False
has_special = False

special_chars = "@#$%^&*!?"

for char in password:
    if char.isupper():
        has_upper = True
    elif char.islower():
        has_lower = True
    elif char.isdigit():
        has_digit = True
    elif char in special_chars:
        has_special = True

if (len(password) >= 8 and has_upper and has_lower
        and has_digit and has_special):
    print("Strong Password")

elif len(password) >= 6 and has_lower and has_digit:
    print("Medium Password")
